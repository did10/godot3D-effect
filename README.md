# godot3D effect
A 2D shader which creates the illusion of a 3D room (like in five nights at freddy's)

More work is required, you probably should change the viewport size and the sprite position with the screen resolution.
There also is a small 3D scene with wich you can compare the effect to a real 3D scene. I diden't read any papers about the topic, just tried around some stuff.

Godot 3.2.1 project 

Use it for what ever you want.
